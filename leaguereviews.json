  "review": "When you start playing this game not only will you be punished by its deep learning curve, its design randomness, its bad matchmaking and toxic people, no, you will also play almost all of your first couple rounds of blindpick, unless you have enough friends, playing along with a group of new players/exp bots, against a team of atleast 3 premades, one is new, the other, smurfing on new accounts. they actually seem to organize this kind of newbie bashing over stuff like porofessor nowadays. you can still have fun, i guess, but the moment anything goes wrong in a game, expect a toxic flame war for no reason whatsoever. chatting makes no difference, so basically mute chat before playing.If you have friends, this game is ok, if you are solo, dont expect to enjoy your time. The meta never really evolvesevery championship is a pool from like 30 champions who are always used, plus whatever is broken atmthey enforce playstyles for champions with the game designlow level queuing is literally bots vs smurfs vs smurfs vs botsi really dont know if there is actually new players in this game ever, because i cannot fathom how someone would like to spend the first 10 matches of a \"free 2 play\" game getting stomped by people who played this game for probably 1000+ hours while noone on the team communicates.i believe the last real person made an account during corona, and since then its just smurfs xDoh, also the matchmaking is literally not really visible and even your own real ranking is rough guesstimates. And unlike in dota 2, you cannot choose to not play with or against premades (which skews the mm even more)New champions are basically repackaged old onesbut now strongif you got 4 friends, this rating might go up by 4 stars, but when you play alone, or you just start out? i am not sure 1 star isnt too many, to be honest, not for the year 2023, the gameplay is just not good enough, and the balancing is getting more and more wack.",

And as for me, part of the blame for this lies with the top streamers who encourage and demonstrate on large audience (often 13+y.o) inappropriate behavior.

  "review": "While the concept of League is standard and executed \"decently\"(More upon this later). Its community is purely toxic, and some of their characters don't show much skill as it's \"predictions\" but hard to dodge. Small things like these might be called \"part of the game\", but it really doesn't help this game. This game is solely focused on mental health rather than any skill. If you're mentally able, you'll find that some of the players you play against are super easy, but that's because they are in a bad mindset where this game truly shows its fangs in the community. Now while I said it was executed decently, the flaws in this game are apparent once you play. One of the first problems is the fact that you HAVE to play with your teammates until the game is over, or you surrender. Otherwise, you get penalized. Having to stick with toxic players is bad, but not the worst of things. However, even if your power went out, or your router died. You'd still get punished, even when it's casual. Also, you can lose out on prizes even if you rejoin back. Secondly, its community/foundation. Its community is comprised of people who are either toxic and can't work(very worst outcome) to very good and can work. However, most people can't work together as their roles start mixing or they want to talk a certain part of the map(game mechanics). The game mechanics are based on 5 classes. Each having their own role/lane. Most of the game is based on the balance of these. However, because some people are bad, the entire balance of the game will be thrown. Probably the most annoying part of \"LoL\" is its characters. Its characters are not very fair to anyone. You can be highly skilled but lose to a basic player who has a better character.",

People u are patched with are supposed to be the same skillset but they are not you either get very low skilled or no skill at all in your team that makes 4 of them and you are left 5v1 and you keep looking at 4 people chasing one of the enemies leaving all objectives behind and 4 of the enemies ganking on you getting you killed while defending alone. Mastery locked champions are played in ranked at this elo they are first of all pathetic leave alone playing a champ they don't even know how to use him..!! I have been playing this game for a very long time solo que ranked and you cannot grow.. People will tell you stop blaming am doing it wrong but that's not the case even you get 9 cs per min and have a perfect wave control. win your lane take objectives, perfect build, lane control, perfect KDA (Kill/Death/Assist) perfect positioning and lot more ect.. you will still lose be because simple fact its a 5v1 occasionally you get a team who knows what they are doing and you no doubt will ez coz u are already good.. out of 100% you gettin a good team on solo matchmaking is 15%..

Every single ranked game, and I mean every single one, at least one player calls for another player to be reported. The report culture in this game is debilitating for a routine player. In most situations the player is not worthy of being reported as they have done nothing wrong but been less skilled at the game than the reporter. I have seen in time and time again when a player is behaving perfectly fine but still receives a report from the team just for a low score. Getting enough reports in one game will give you an INSTANT BAN. This is done instantly by a system there is no review whatsoever. This means that the players that are doing the reporting have the power and there is no limit on how many people you report. I have seen players who just report the entire team when they lose a game or 3 man flex teams who will target report one specific player just to get them automatically banned by the system. Riot does not reduce ban lengths even for players who were banned without review. I was chatbanned for 25 games just for calling a player who was intentionally feeding ( a score of 0/22/0) a crybaby. This ban was given to me instantaneously and with no review whatsoever. When I sent in a support ticket to Riot Games not only does it take forever for them to get back to you their responses are extremely unprofessional as well. My response was one of sympathy for my situation and the support agent even expressed willingness to reduce my ban 'if he could'.

Legit comments/questions are buried under useless posts about (I did this/that, LCS/LCK/LCE posts ..etc),- LoL Reddit posts getting closed for no apparent reason despite they  are not toxic or BMs anyone or anything but discusses a legit concern about Ranks/Queues..etc. i.e we allow only posts that are positive about game or advertise for the game. - Game wont die but for sure won't maintain the same population. 1kkk registered player does not mean 1kkk are playing, but means so many smurfs, players with multiple accounts, or just dead accounts. 1 million active player at the same time? But this out of the 100kk playerss registered. - Competitive scenes are boring, nothing interesting...When all champs played in tournament don't go above 20 out of the 140+ champs released then you know how bad the game is.   Lastly, the design/balance team needs to be replaced with fresh blood that have better understanding of the game and balancing.",

If your a new player DO NOT BOTHER. this game is rampart with Smurf accounts (People who create new accounts to play against players who should be learning the game because they have a small wiener.)  You will NOT learn anything from constantly getting killed and then harassed by your fellow teammates because your a new player playing where new players belong and your not on the Smurf account standards. I dare anyone to tell me I'm wrong and that this game is friendly towards new players. The community is toxic, rather then teach they name call and harass. This has been a problem back when LOL first came out and it's a problem now that has yet to be addressed..

A sport that is fun to watch but horrible to play.Simply: it isn't designed around the majority of its player base. (which is ranked gold division and below btw.). As terrible as this sounds it does make sense. You don't balance your sport around those picking up a ball and player in their backyard. You design with the Champion's League in mind. Great for the sport, horrible for the game.Riot Games is a Chinese-owned company nowadays and will therefore cater to that market. Another move that destroyed it. Monetization that extends well into the balancing of the game. They force newly released champions to overperform so that people will be drawn to them and buy the champion \u0026 skins. Nobody wants to play the new joker at 40% win rate or lower after all.Stay away.",

Its sad I like this game, URF is great, but they don't want to keep it. They give it to us for maybe a month now at best. They don't listen to their fan base and that is why this game is slowly dying. Not just in E-sports but in general. Riot will always have left a mark on the E-sport world but they are old. The game is full of Xbox 360 kids. They say they have a report system and it works. That is laughable at best. Their system is so broken that most people do not report and unfortunately that is making a toxic repetitive cycle, only people left are people who are also toxic.

But if you say any rude words towards them? You're gone instead. For a better example, watch Dunkey's classic \"I'm done with League of Legends\" video. Pretty much still holds true today.Modern League of Legends has lost all value and soul, forcing garbage K/DA marketing and videos attracting the lowest of the low to the game. Instead of people who actually care about the state of it. Current Riot champ design and balancing is; \"Is it unique? Ship it.\" Even if the balancing for it is utter garbage and not fun to play against, then they'll probably keep nerfing numbers until finally caving in and reducing the often overloaded kits, probably an insecure set of hires who can't admit to screwing up a champ. Best part is that their current focus on releasing more overloaded champs instead of polishing up some of the older ones (When League was better) because of money. Which is the equivalent to having a half dirty room but the other side is clean, where they continue to add more to the clean side but the entire room still looks filthy because of the other side which is ignored.

After more then 6 years playing this game i call quits this game is total trash now !",

At first, it is the most marvellous experience the abundance of champions and lore about them is sure to keep you entertained for hours and hours. It's an infinite learning simulator where every little improvement gives you an immense return but that's the good part...This game will make you love it just so little by little it can tear you down..If you choose to take it serious it will frustrate you, drive you insane and enrage you at any corner...The overloaded kits, the player base, the publisher, the game itself it will make a huge dent in you as a person... It will make you a worse human being and the worst part is that once you've reached this threshold it's almost impossible to quit because you long for that same feeling you felt when you first started playing. In conclusion, do not under any circumstance play this game, the short time benefit and happiness are not at all worth the long term damge.",

  "review": "I LOVED this game, But when i get matched with people in ranked who have the following mindsets: \"You don't deserve this win\", \"GG (at 5 mins in), \"Uninstall\", or anything really that is not positive; it is IMPOSSIBLE to enjoy this game.  I don't care to lose as long as I know my team is trying 100% of the time and we did everything.  THAT IS NEVER the case especially in lower ELO (Where I am currently stuck due to the aformentioned reasons above).  I KNOW that I am a better player than what I am getting matched with and I know I am WAY better than just silver.  I want to learn more about where I should be rather than find out no matter how much a research this game and find was \"SHOULD\" work for the situation and just decide to go full damage and carry myself out from the support role.  WHY is it impossible to climb.  I don't need a pay to win coach to get out of this elo.  I KNOW how to get out, but when people are deliberately losing games or being toxic for the sake of self-satisfaction of ruining someones game, I CANT DO IT!  Even if I know we can win the game and we are far behind others DO NOT believe in their own skill or trust anyone to win the game. So tell me how I am supposed to enjoy the benefits of any buffs/nerfs to the game when the result is always the same? WHY.  I Put so much effort and take breaks and still F***ing lose the same EVERY. F***ing.  TIME!  This is the ONLY game I play and I love it, but I cant enjoy it if my teammates cant get past their egos and play as a team.  You think we enjoy this game because we can play with our friends?  INCORRECT.  We enjoy this game because it gives us a special time to shine and beat the sh** outta other players knowing we are better and smarter.  Other games Ive played have never offered this feeling of power (the healthy kind).  It shouldnt matter what anyone picks in the game as long as they are good and can build to the conditions of the match (Which I do most of the time).  But as a nearly 10-year member of this game, I am getting matched with players that are asking why an AP assassin does so much damage to them and come to find out they REFUSE to build magic resistances or ward effectively.  I get theres new people everyday, but there is absolutely NO CONSISTENCY in how I am getting matched or people that care about winning the game at all costs as I do.  Im sorry I have not experienced this.  Yes, statistically we cant win EVERY game, but you can win MORE if you try to get out of the tough situation rather than say \"GG\" and the rest of your team surrenders leaving you alone knowing you could've done something.  MARK MY WORDS RIOT, I will quit this game entirely and tell others not to try it for the sake of their mental sanity and worth as a online player.  This game is fun when you are matched with more people that care in ranked.  I dont want to be matched with people that are not fit to play ranked games.  Thats why normals exists. But b/c you all watch the pros and they exist players are trying things they KNOW they cant play and are trying it out in ranked just because someone said it was \"OP\" Rather than building on the knowledge they acquired through extensive research of the game and trust in their own ability to play whatever champion suits them.  But Ive discovered, I cannot even enjoy my picks because I am being ridiculed because its something someone else didn't like or they are just glued to one play style.  But thats the difference between me and the rest of the players.  I know what I do works , but I cant ever get to a point where i am useful enough to prove it because the screen says \" Your team has agreed to surrender\".  That is demoralizing.  And i have seen this too many times to count and I will NOT stand for this anymore!  I want to play knowing the others care enough to at least stay in the game to try.  This \"I have calculated we will lose\" is BULLSH**!  So what, they may mess up and we could win.  Yet, you put the \"Hostage\" option as a report.  Thats the DUMBEST thing to ever happen in this game.  Some people do like to hold others \"Hostage\". But if you have the mentality that you run away from a game you find \"Unplayable\" then you  should NOT be wasting your time playing ranked.  SURRENDER should NEVER be an option.  You don't see the pros do it! Yet that the biggest thing the players dont follow.  PLAY TO THE VERY END.   I could go on for EONS about how much my experience has changed negatively especially when I lose a game.  This review is not out of spite after losing a match.  This is a culmination of anger, disgust, regret, and most of all depression and oppression over the years with this game.  I should NOT be losing games I know I can win with my knowledge and I should be having MORE fun regardless of the result.  I have not felt happy about this game in years.  Let that sink in.  Sadly this is the only game i can turn to for gaming bc i invested so much time in it to be a successful player.  Summoner -Demacian Impact",

Then there is the match making they promised to fix and they just made things worse. Promised better champion and item balance. Nope, they made it worse. Legitimately Riot Games did the impossible. They took a game that was currently in it's worse season ever (10) and made it even worse with (S11). It went from a fun game to just a big fat pile of trash. The vast majority of players are toxic, rude, and make for a very unpleasant gaming experience.

I say this because I consistently have frame-rate drops in the middle of games and the opposing characters seem to move much faster than I can process.

They have never fixed the issues within the game due to the frame rate dropping and the matchmaking ladder being unbalanced.

Wrong on both fronts you incompetent F-slurs, because I have one of the best GPUs and graphics cards money can buy and my internet connection is completely stable.

They step into political (in)correctness whenever they can to please their Chinese overlords. Their ingame policy is as awful as that. You get banned for trashtalking. That sounds fair in the beginning, but feeding (ruining the game) does nothing. So instead of muting the one with the bad temper, you get banned for trying/playing good and have the audacity to talk smack about a player refusing to play. That garbage U.S. culture is disgusting; no-one on the actual football, soccer or basketball field would say: \"Oh, let's punish the one that carries us because he said \"***hole\" once\". The second problem is the absolute rigged \"matchmaking\". During the time of writing this, I have played 7 ranked games. I have a winrate of 0%. My latest \"team\" scores (if you want to call these \"players\" teammates) are 0-11 and 1-21. There is literally 0% chance to win this when each lanes feeds an average of 3.5 deaths. I have never seen such a joke of a manipulation right into your face. When I check those \"team mates\" over OP.GG, I see they have 17% winrates while the enemy sports 60%, 78% etc. This is pure match manipulation at its best.Don't even think to try to play, you could play Roulette in Monte Carlo and get more reliable \"matchmaking\" out of rolling dice than this rigged and manipulated nonsense.(RIOT even has a patent dated 2014 in the U.S. patent database where they admit they rig and manipulate the games to add social scoring instead of actual skill - let that sink in!)The customer support is a joke. I have several accounts (from the time the game was not as Chinese as it is now) and they always respond with: \"I have been there, too\" or \"I know the feels, bro\" (sic!) This sort of stopping you and try to internet-hug you instead of listening is disgusting and very American too. Sweeping problems under the rug like Soviet Russia times - try to talk to RIOT Game's \"support\" callcenter monkeys.The game is bugged as well. The client, since done by RIOT's downsyndrome wannabe programmers, is a ressource-hogging mess. They even admit in a paper they still have millions of client crashes per year (I think it was 2.6 mill). The pathfinding is messed up, minions glitch back and forth and you spin in place for seconds - a joke for a point'and'click game like this where it's needed you can move freely.The game is also absolutely power-creeped, because RIOT has a financial interest in having no-mana champs with overloaded kits, a proper skill measurement and competitive combat is not possible if you don't play their latest, overpowered released characters. Also, the game becomes more and more \"weeb\", with pink Bambi things that say \"Pew pew!\", pink-haired singers on floating hoverboards with speakers, cats on floating books, \"Sailor Moon\" skins etc.RIOT GAMES is a garbage company that employs people that fail in life and have barely elementary school education, which shows in the poor game quality. Their champanion balance guy in charge said: \"You don't have to play the game in order to balance it\". I kid you not. That is saying: \"I don't need to have a drivers licence to drive Formula 1\". The person inc charge for the power creep said he never designed characters prior. As you can see, RIOT is a company full of garbage employees, skill not required, but apparently people fart into each other's faces as reports from former staff members told. And that shows int the game itself - It is a clown-fiesta style-wise and rigged gameplay-wise, while still manage to have glitches and bugs eveywhere. Don't bother, play sometihng else.",

The game as of current is in my opinion bad, due to the playerbase and just overloaded new content release because riot is running out of ideas. Playing the game casually is possible although you'll still encounter many games with afks, toxic players and games where you're useless because a champ on the enemy team eats you alive due to the champ needing low skill to play but high skill to play against. I wouldn't recommend ranked its just casual games but with 10x the toxic players, you get the same rewards as challengers at a low low rank of gold which should be your peak if you want to keep playing casual, anything above that is a game of chance, whoever gets the best team-wins you can have the skill of a plat player and still be hard stuck at silver due to random teams and no communication. I would recommend avoiding the game, its fun but can very addictive and can affect you mentally and physically, the harm is too drastic and there's better games to play that won't have so many problems. I recommend Albion or runescape for mmo rpgs (Increadibly nice community) , Apex or valorant for shooters (high skill gap, will be hard to play well), and maybe rocket league for just a chill time.",

My alt account got banned and i felt like it was pretty unfair, I had played around 30+ ranked games at the beggining of the season and straight up carried and told people to stop being toxic and be positive so we can win but everyone still flamed, got mad at the 2 last games and called someone a \"cu.nt\" because he wanted to learn a new player in a competitive game and went 0/15 at the first 10 mins after someone told him that he should not play mid ever again. You might have a few good games where everything will seem perfect and have fun but that doesnt last long at all, You will, and i repeat you will always have a guy on your team that goes 0/6 after coming 3 mins late and crying that he had less farm and say that his jungler to get cancer.

Every year this game is getting worse and worse, now it's is unplayable in my opinion, at least in the low ranks from iron to Platinum in my experience. In all these years I have been suspended and banned from the game 2 times, the first was two years ago because I lost my patience and flamed a troller-feeder, of course the troller was not banned. The second time was yesterday because again I lost my temper and flamed a troller-feeder who had 2 kills and 16 deaths only at the tenth minute of the game in the gold elo. He started feeding on perpuce because our top laner didn't help him with an objective. Of course riot chose to suspend me for 14 days without even a warning message while this player continues  playing League untouched by riot. I am forced to play with these players every time I click the play button, I have report so many but riot looks the other way like these players do not exist, I have never seen someone being banned because he/she fed or trolled and trust me I have reported so many. First of all do not even bother to report  someone for feeding or giving up, secondly do not even bother to download the game unless you want to troll, feed or  be  one of the leavers and third I should not even start with the balance in the game or the match making system.

So our accounts can get hacked and used by other people, and then banned. I am upset because I had invested a lot of money and a lot of time on that account and definitely do not plan on doing that again.

I greatly enjoy the game and have spent many hours enjoying it with my friends. I have had my account since around about 2012/2013 (not too sure) and have been a fan of the game, lore and (at times) the community.Rewind to late October 2016,I had a long period of inactivity in which I did not play the game due to work and university responsibilities. After reconnecting contact with one of my LoL playing friends, I decided to reinstall the game and take part in the halloween event.After installation, I attempted to log in and found that my account had been suspended permanently, at this point, I'm wondering why, as I've had a whole year or so out of the game.I log in to my web acount to find game history with the account for the past 30 days. I immediately opened a support ticket in hopes of finding out what had happened. Customer support informed me that my account had been used for exploits or hacks. I of course do not condone of such game-altering factors and have spent a fair amount of money on the game, So i'd not wish to see my account closed.I requested to know what IP address had logged into my account at the time of the exploits/hacks, to which they did not respond appropriately. I received several responses along the lines of \"We've banned the account for scripts,hacks or exploits\" without explaining further. I was then informed that sharing my account of any kind is against the TOS.My account has never been shared and at this point I'm certain that my account has been compromised, I treid to explain to the support agents who responded that my account needed further investigation, as I would like to prove that my account had indeed been compromised and needed reinvestigation. They would not respond appropriately.I had tried to mention that my account could not be properly secured as I received no notification of access to my account, nor do they currently offer a 2-step verification process to help secure accounts.I requested to have the issue escalated to a supervisor or higher, but I have not received a response since.

The constant changes for top level play and pro play make the game feel like it wasn't meant for you just by queuing, they ask you to select two roles then give you an 80% chance of being autofilled into the other roles you don't want to play. The game design and balance team should be fired immediately and whoever designed the last year of champions should be removed from the development team instantly. If the game isn't working stop trying to fit a round shape into a square hole and actually listen to your community's feedback. IT. ISN'T. FUN.",

Champs like Bard with their just weird enough kits show that. However, I can no longer support this game or Rito.Why?When someone passive-aggressively calls out for making a couple bad plays, upping their ante until they're calling me a r*tard. I, of course, called them a c*nt. A thunderc*nt if you while, cooch muncher if you must.What does that earn?14-day mute, 5 game low-prio queue or w/e tf it's called in this game.A company is allowed to make their own rules about social conduct, and I respect that decision.

  "review": "Leauge of Legends was once a pretty good game, the ranked system wasnt perfet but it was fine and games werent that onesided. Out of 10 games there is maybe 1 game where both teams are equally good and the win feels like you earned something and the loose does not feel that bad either. But nowdays you get queued with mostly ppl that have no clue about the game. In 10 games i had at least 8 games where the botlane wasnt even able to ping miss, 6 games with hardcore inters (no those werent just bad games 1/9 is not a bad game). The autofill is also the worst idea any company ever had, autofill makes you lose games before they even start. Imagine picking your two roles that you can barely play just to get autofilled into something you have no idea about and thats what most of the games feel like. This game was once about skill and teamplay, now its just about not being good, but rather not having the biggest feeder in your team. Builds became somewhat static, where before you were able to build chars in many ways, most of them became fixxed for certain damage types, where once ezrael ap was viable, it became unplayable (i know twich wasnt supposed to be ap either look at the nerfs he got and how fast they came). Often i also get the feeling that there are diffrent queues for players like winner/loser queue, thats been a mythos but cmon everyone knows this feeling when your playing and losing 10 games in a row where every team played teribbly dont you ? For me this game deserves even less then 1 star right now. I dont even want to mention the effort they put into new champions, like none, best example is viego this champion was so often disabled due to bugs its unbelievable how they even thought it was a good idea to release him. Its like they dont even put any effort into this game anymore.",

Dont waste your time and just find something better to play. ive spent 9 years on-and-off playing this game and what a regret that is, this game has gone from something amazing to a trash, cash grab mess. just to add im absolutely confident that riot riggs the matchmaking when you are either on a big win streak or you are in your promotional series on ranked because i always get a bad team in my promos and always lose the game, just randomise the matches and stop rigging the games to make them harder to rank up. also next season looks like an absolute farce and a joke, why do riot suck-off invisibility? its op and it needs counter play! it is way too strong at the moment and it needs addressing, these 2 new dragons are game destroying buffs and currently elder dragon is way too op, what the hell are you doing to this game riot.",

It's not even a MOBA anymore . It used to be about strategy and thought. Like chess.Old rune + mastery system ... more items , options ... no ward limits , more summoner spells... creativity , no unique passives, no ban on same item stacking... all of that is gone man... they fuckking killed this game You could theorycraft whatever you wanted back in the game and it fuckiing worked!! Full ms speed nasus , tank jinx , full ad malph , full attack speed taric , whatever Now it's pick this , buy our skin , stfu and have a stressful game ... and we'll ban you anyway at some point to steal your fuckking money.I'm out , this isn't the same shhit anymore .

  "review": "The games total garbage now. I've been around since season 1 but I think I'm finally done. I've been up and down the ladder in ranked but it's so stupidly rigged now that can't actually climb at the proper speed or get placed where you belong.For the people that don't know, the game basically sets you up with teams for you to win or lose ahead of time. Your rarely in a position to impact the game. This means if you que up for a game right now. The game will decide if it wants you to win or lose beforehand. If it wants you to win you will get way better team mates then the other team. If it wants you to lose you end up with an impossible to win with team. You and all your practice and skill mean nothing to the system.Then there's player behavior, someone can intentionally and blatantly ruin your and your teams game. This means dieing over and over and doing nothing besides running around. That person will be free to do that forever. Riot won't take proper action against them. AND you won't be compensated for their nonsense. So say goodbye to a half hour of time and ranked score you'll never get back. And it's going to happen a memorable amount of times.To top it all off, if you don't get lucky in your placement matches you can end up in a ranked division that's going to take forever to climb out of because of how the above system now works. So even if you belong in Plat, if you got placed in Bronze, you'll have to grind for roughly 100 hours to get to where you should have been all along despite being better then the people your playing with because the system doesn't actually care when it matchmakes. It just decides if you've won or lost to many games. And it makes it so it takes as long as possible.If they fix the matchmaking so it's fun again and fair, and also take some sort of actual action against trash players the game is better off without, like a zero tolerance policy. We might have a winner again. Till then games on a downward spiral.P.S The new player experience is worse then ever. That's a whole other thing to deal with.",

I am disappointed.I've been playing for two years, and the most fun I had was when I started, I could build whatever items I wanted and experiment, now riot dictates who can build what items with their new mythic system, and its so boring forcing players into a box like this, idk why no one talks about it.The biggest wow killer was taking away talent trees and not allowing the players to experiment. And now league has started down this path mark my words.You'll notice the scum people of league before you even get into a game. They will harass you because of your profile and previous stats and destroy morale before the game even starts. ITS SO EASY TO FIX THIS, TAKE THE NAMES AWAY BUT NOOOO CAUSE WHY NOT? i honestly believe they have a deal with 3rd parties that publish player stats, its the only reason that this is still tolerated despite the ridiculous amount of toxicity it single handedly generates in the game.riot dictates meta, every time they release a new busted character with a small novel for a passive, it completely ruins the game.overloaded kits are also extremely frustrating to play against. LETS TAKE GAREN FOR EXAMPLE.HIS Q IS A DASHIT BREAKS SLOWING EFFECTSIT SILENCESIT DOES DAMAGE1 BUTTON.EXTREMELY UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINSTLETS TAKE SINGED.HIS QTURNS POISON ON/OFF1 BUTTONPower creep is disgusting. you can build 1k ability power and not even get a fraction of that in magic resist. So the game right now is one shot simulator, there is no room for mistakes cause every wrong step you take, ends up with you exploding before you can react. The only reason I can think why they allow this is cause some jerk at the executive level at riot likes to play like this and is jerking off to all the one shots. ITS BEEN LIKE THIS SINCE PRESEASON 11. FOR EXAMPLEI WANNA ROTATE TO HELP MY TEAM WITH SOMETHINGI WALK BY AN UNWARDED BUSH ZED/FIZZ/RENGAR/EVELYNN/INSERT WHOEVER IS WAITING FOR ME THEY BLOW THEIR WHOLE ROTATION ON ME AND I DIE BEFORE I CAN REACT. MAN THATS FUN!ITS IMPOSSIBLE TO WARD EVERY SINGLE BUSH SO HOW IS THIS FUN?INVISIBILITY IS SO UNFUN TO PLAY AGAINST AND THERE IS NO WAY TO COUNTER IT. and riot does. not. care. they get off to it actually. because if they cared about player feedback they would give everyone a way to see invisible players.its so fun laning and pushing when someone appears on top of you and one shots you. =)Smurfing is such a huge a problem and they don't even mention it in the patch notes. You'll get people that wipe the floor with your whole team but they're on a new level 30 account and riot doesnt care.then you'll have people on your team that clearly bought their account and have 30 cs into a 25 minute game, theres a whole black market for this. Both of these could be solved with creative solutions like Dota does.autofill makes me rage quit the game, i dont care if i lose lp, i hate being forced to play a role i don't practice on.solo queue is not actually solo queue because you have duo mixed in with it. so you can imagine all the kinds of problems this brings.You'll get troll duos who purposely throwYou'll get boosters who smurf to boost their friend who has literally no idea what they're doing.The people that play this game ruin it, and instead of not allowing for this kind of error, riot does nothing about it.SOLO QUEUE SHOULD BE SOLO.

  "review": "I sincerely want you to know how much I hate your Ranked matchmaking crap. It's funny when you win a lot of SoloQ games and you progress on that so called \"ladder\" but then the system throws at you all those losers with below 50% WR boosted imbeciles and you lose. For god's sake, I went down from G2 to G4 in no time, although wasting a lot of time for nothing. Non stop trollers or those losers that just want to pick a jungle for the support role just because they can. And you know what? Your report system doesn't work. Never ever do people who troll get banned, but it's ok. You make money from those twitch streamers you support. Focus on your \"Pro Player\" worlds, whatever it is and keep releasing K-Pop E-girls' skins for all those \"subhumans\" to buy and jerk off to those skins instead of focusing on your game. On a side note, \"Arcane\" was a good TV Series but with all good things you'll screw it up just like you did with League :) All the best wishes and hope you rest in peace, wiener suckers!",

I am very likely something like iron/bronze, but I got matched with people platinum+ in draft after I won like 3 matches in a row.. this is just scam, thank god this trash is free.I also opened a ticket for that, and they say \"yeah it's because you have to be at 50% of winrate\". How is that even a thing, just match me with idi0ts like me (and like this platform that doesn't allow the word \"idi0ts\") who don't care about the \"advanced mechanics\".I fuck1ng play this game to turn off my brain, not to be frustrated by guys who so much free time that they can actually be good at this game (one hell of a skill to have tho).I would do something like this for instance:1. You just create a proper matchmaking, with EVERYONE in both teams at the same level.2. Improve this trash AI, so that I can have fun while playing against it. At the moment it's really garbage, which is probably similar to the developers level.",

You introduce new bugs, glitches and functions on top of already problematic features in the game. You don't fix critical obvious issues that occur constantly and for whatever reason you can't fix you call it a feature and that it is intended. That has left this game unstable, soon unplayable and honestly I am amazed it still run after all that spagehetti code you have never bothered to fix.My second topic is the Matchmaking system. Garbage we don't need to tell you anything else than it is garbage.Third topic report system. Well if you try to talk sense into your team mates by raising an obvious error and provide usefull tip and information is considered flame, toxic and is by riot classified as reportable issue. In the end, it results with chat ban, and in worst case according to them, total ban. However I don't think they ban anyone unless it is obvious cheating. You won't find any worse game when it comes to handle pure insane toxic behavior since Riot Games can't see the difference between helping and griefing.Riot games only focus on what E-sport wants and just does not care what average players wants. They do some rather non critical polls around skins but outside money making areas as skins they don't care. They keep announcing changes and fixes and deliver the opposite and made it worse.",

  "review": "So...  Where should i start.I've been playing this game since season 3.Although i never could get into higher than D1, I've had some inside views of the game. First of all congrats for the visualization and the music team backwards on, for the SR remake and Pentakill (still one of my favourite albums).Secondary...The pace and the aim of the game has change very much over the few years... (There's a riot introducing shortfilm on netflix, highly recommending it). From that we know, how small the riot company was when it first had the idea of a wow-dota crossover moba game. Its aim was to make a game that players could enjoy, and make great inventions of champions, items comboes, etc. In comparison what you see nowadays is 4 tanks in a game, or a Kayle/Kassadin. And you know you're gonna loose, cause your team responds with \"tg\" to some useful guidance and your job as a laner is meaningless, cause you might get then into 0/10, they feed him and eventually he carries the game down. So you go into a game and even at the loading screen you can see that it's gonna waste 20-40 minutes of your life. Try to not get frustrated! And for this, obviously, the biggest part of the community, the low-elo players are insanely toxic and tryharding, cause they get and ego boost by playing broken, unbalanced champ, unkownly forcing them to tryhard even more, and ruin the casual experience of the game. Every 4/5 games you'll get a troll/afk/afk farm, etc. for the reasons i've mentioned above.Tertiary:So you have (about) 155 champs, right? Then may i get a reason why i can only see 20-25 of them no matter how many games i play? Again: Tryharding. But the saddest part is that they are broken in EVERY aspect of the game. When a kassadin, a late game champ can oneshot you in early game, and you are useless against him as an AD assassin, or hen fiora, the model of anti tank is useless against tanks (we'll get to it later, at the items), or when an adc's most broken way is getting it to ap. Just why. I know it looks cool in the LCS and WCS, but we don't have that type of level, and it's boring here.Quaternary: The items. I get it. I have 5k hours in league, 6k in WoW, I do know how a constant change is important to a game. But as in everything else, quality over quantity. And I accept that you've wanted the most out of the game, but is this surely the way? When tanks become gods only with one item, immobilized adc's get a mobility, so you can't even outplay them while they are destroying youm or an item that doubles the dmg buff of conqueror, so you can't properly 1v1 that particular champ. I can only visualize it with wow. World of Warcraft BfA had a lot of changes, half of the playerbase quit the game. Howewer, WoD had half of the changes, players still enjoyed their raids and dungeons, because they were one of the best ones in wow history (as always, pardon for the exceptions, and i can't speak in anyone's name, these are my own reviews and observations).(These are going to be my own oppinions.)Quinary: The gamemodes. I realyl like what you've did with Odyssey. In fact, that's my favourite gamemode in lol. and yet, You only see one for all and Urf. and not even Arurf, to motivate people to think and get creative with their given situation, no. Same bans, same picks everytime. Like a ranked without LP but with the same frustration and tryhard. Boring. as everything, Odyssey had its meta builds for questing, but with the perks and the items, the customization, you had PLENTY of choices and ways to make it entertaining. splash-hit malphite, rocket-bomber jinx, etc. It forced the players to think. and that was great. now in the shop, you get the recommended item to oyur face with a 1920*1080 size. Way to keep the motivation to think low...I'm quitting after many years of fun. I really liked your game. But that's the past.Au revoir.",

NOTHING in this client shows its one of the most popular games at the moment. But lets say you made it through and you get to start looking for a game. If you are a new player you are going to have a hard time with high elo smurfs shitting on new players, just because it satisfies their virgin brains. But, maybe you have an old account you can go back to that has a higher level, eh? Maybe it wont be so bad for you! Well sorry to dissapoint, but it will be worse. This means you have basic knowledge of the game, and you will only be more irritated by the unbalanced champions that are currently ''meta''. Some champions have become a win condition, which means that if you have one on your team your chances of winning rise by 20 percent. You want to find your own champion that suits you? Wouldnt recommend. just play one of the 20 champions that are actually good. (im quite sure that riot is actually proud of that number, considering the amount of champs that get attention by them, leaving the biggest part in the dust). The only good thing I have to say about this game is that it's not pay to win. But dont get too excited, because the cosmetics have gotten way more expensive over the years! basically you can get champions withour cosmetics for free, and thats it. Just dont play this game. Its not worth the effort you need to put into it to become an average player, and you might get addicted like the current playerbase of the game.

The power spikes and snowball are out of control too.3The automated player report system can't even detect soft flame, it only detects explicit politically incoreect speak.In game currency system has been reworked to fit more and more into a lootbox boogaloo.

Riot's matchmaking ignores stats and win rates and will pair you with anybody no matter what the skill level. This will put higher elo players into games where they have to carry players just goofing off. There's no way to be competitive. Second, matchmaking will put a solo queue player in groups of 2 or more, and then your lane will wind up getting ganged up on all game because your own team is too busy with their buddies to pay attention to you.Most of the games you are thrown into will have people literally testing every nerve you have with constant chat log abuse, name calling, blaming, and blatantly sitting in the base for 20 minutes while your team is forced into unfair situation.After years of complaints, patience tested, and the inability to actually have fun playing for the last year---I'm done with it. I can spend my money on something else more enjoyable than this PoS cash grab.To make matters worse, Riot has claimed they are fixing most of these issues---yet, it's only a ploy because they know they are on the verge of losing their entire fan base to toxic people who only play to ruin the fun of the game.

The game itself is great but the players that ruin the experience don't get banned anymore.

  "review": "-Que Times- Autofill has ruined this game. people want to play what they que for but the system says screw all that. In the interests of \"faster que times\" the system takes 10 secs to find a 2 players that pick their role and then 3 other random people and says you can fill these slots. It doesn't even do a good job of selecting which players get get their roles.  I just had a game where the system put 2 top mains 2 sup mains and an ADC main on the same team. I got top the other top main was forced mid. One play got support and the other was forced jungle. Neither of these players knew their role and it showed. In  a RANKED game I have to play with players that do not know what they are doing and its no wonder we lost.  I am plat Elo my average que time are between 30 secs -3 mins. This is fast the problem is you are giving up the quality of your teammates for fast que times. it use to be the que times were too long now they are a shorter but you are getting put with autofill players every game. So the system finds players fast but it doesn't care who it picks. It just grabs a handful of players at random and says here is your team. So the system gaslights you about your \"chosen\" roles and just puts you where ever to make sure ques times stay low. Matchmaking- The MMR system is rigged ranked. When you are on winning streaks it feels like the system says oh you think you are good well prove it. Here are 4 players that are either off role/first timing champs/trolling/ AFk/ Etc. now carry them. When you do well the system not only puts you against better players but pairs you with worse players. The MMR system wants to keep everyone as close to %50 Win rate as possible. Feels like a crooked carnival. Coin flip matchmaking. -Champion balance- What should balance mean? Riot pushes the narrative that they want every champion to be balanced at a %50 win rate. They advertise that league is a game that you can pick any champ build any items and express yourself however you want but yet why are there champions that have consistent 47% win rate with 1.8% pick rate? Because its all a lie. Balance and meta is artificial. Riot picks and chooses which champions are going to be strong intentionally. This leaves champions in unplayable states for literal years until riot decides that its a bad champs turn to be broken. Balance patches happen every 2-4 weeks and still somehow champions remain unplayable. - Player to Developer communication- In short there is none. Riot removed the official league forums. They say reddit (a third party website)  is the only avenue for discussion. There is no direct way to voice concerns or issues. When issues are brought up on Reddit riot will respond condescendingly assuring you that they are smarter then you and know best. Except many issues that have been known for years never are addressed.  Every now and then you will get an in client message requesting feedback but its just multiple choice and the essay section where you can voice concerns  will never get read.Champions - The thematic and over all design of champs is great. The problem though is has power creep continues to climb the NEW champs are always extremely over powered.  Because they are so strong and people want to win you only ever see the same 25 champs . Out of 151 champions only 25 are picked consistently.  Talk about boring.  At this stage in the game every new champ that comes out fills a role or situation or is just a straight up better version of an existing champ. What is the point of having so many champions if some champs are just clearly better then the others. Toxicity - Because of all of the issues listed above toxicity exists. People get frustrated at this broken mess of a game and understandably lash out at other players. The match making system screws you with bad players, The client crashes and causes you to lose your promos, you champion sucks you can do nothing but pray that riot feels the same way . All of the leagues systems create frustration and because there is no outlet to express these frustrations players take it out on one another. Riot currently only cares about verbal toxicity because its easy to catch. All they do is set up a robot that when some one get reported the robot looks are the chat logo in game looks for \"taboo\" words and if they are found sends punishments. but it only catches those players if the auto detect system finds one of those words.  There is no context to this just a computer checking of boxes. The real toxicity is inting, Afk, trolling. these things cant be picked up on by a robot so they never get caught. but if you were to flame a person literally ruining your match and you call them a nono word oops looks like you get the ban not the game runnier. Riot has done nothing to stop this behavior.",

Don`t even think to go ranked nowadays because 9/10 you get a player that is afk. No matter if it`s in from team or the other (most of the time it`s from your team). Therefore, I think they really need to find a way for players to stay hooked on the game while they play because this is annoying and makes the players uninstall the game( which I just did). So yea, basically, trash players but fun game. If there could be a way to shutdown the flamers/quitters and let only the real players in. Think about it. Even if you think that he will be soon a \"customer\" because maybe he will buy the skins I don`t think it`s worth it. 10+ players I`m sure they`ll quit because of him. But that`s just my opinion.",

I and 3 other people invented the aram game back in 2010. You also didn't say thank you, and now the rascals with your changes have screwed up our skills and are dragging the small audience, which has grown into selfishness without education and respect for its players. make changes in the game so that it has a rating, and that weak players are not allowed in one team and strong players in the other. there has to be a balance, you don't have it and it's endless how much anger I've built up and years of life wasted in this game and you made fun of all the players my age and almost my age.

I would say one out of every 3 games there is someone on a fake throwaway account who has que’d up to purposefully ruin ur game cuz they think it’s funny and ur stuck dealing with that for 15-30min. And you can report them but riot does nothing about it. EVERY THIRD GAME… and every other third game someone isn’t purposefully trolling but is just so bad at the game that they went 0/14 in the first 10min somehow and so now it’s a complete waste of time…. And then the other 1 in 3 games ur auto-filled in a role that u don’t enjoy and aren’t good at or someone on ur team is auto filled in a role they don’t enjoy and aren’t good at and the vibe is just bad from the start. The champion balance is also so messed up. Some champions are no-skill giga overturned and others require a lot of skill to play but even if you take the time to learn and get good they are just hella weak and underpowered. Riot doesn’t care about any of that. They just want to sell skins. They don’t care about the user experience at all. Trash game. Trash company.

You play tons of games and get no experience for champs or anything unless unlocked through the loot system. I find it quite fruststrating how many champs they have now and how you used to get IP for playing games back in the day to earn champions and now you hardly get points to unlock any champs. More most verteran players probably already have almost every champ so this isn't much of a problem but for new players this is a big blow to actually making this game enjoyable. It feels like you have to play this game twice as much with still very little reward for playing the game. This doesn't seem balanced at all and it really takes away how much fun this game used to be. Bring back the IP system.

One can rarely play the champs they love as they are no longer \"meta\", cannot enjoy the game for the purpose of enjoying the game, and lets not get started on the smurfing/LP loss.....no. I always loved jungler due to the concept of ganking. Now, with the new rotation, jungling has become about having a time bomb in the back of my head and getting drakes or herald. In the end win or lose, it is no longer fun.....really, it is just no longer fun and rather ends up leaving you feeling toxic. I do still enjoy arams only but SR has become a platform for their precious E-sports and not the regular METARito, let me give you a suggestion since you guys always complain about \"not being able to cater to the low Elo and high Elo\" simultaneously.....make a 3rd map that caters to stomping or meta objectives....cater to that 1% and leave SR to be a proper Moba based game for the rest of us lower elos to enjoy.....really really really listen to what your community is saying",

You will never get back the money spent in the game!2.and the most important:the game was not created for fair play competition and equal level of players (there is no team balance). The game was created only for the money from micro transactions.3. Do not count on a nice and nice skirmish with players of a good level. 99% of gamers are children aged 8-12 who spend their parents' money on micro-transactions. They buy character skins, crates and other crap.4. In a game, a good player will never be appreciated.Only children who spend their parents' money !!!!5. Although the game was supposedly made for 5v5, in 90% of the games you will unfortunately play only 1v9.6. DO NOT USE CHAT AT ALL !!!!!!! using chat will get you banned. No matter what you write. Don't use chat !!!7. The game has no TEAM BALANCE at all. in 90% of the games you will get 4 f**king jerks that will ruin your game.8. There are no rules in the game. This means you can do whatever you want (troll the game). Any noob, regardless of skill level, can play in any position.9. Do not play RANKED games under any circumstances.After all, you don't want to be nervous, get a heart attack and have your account banned when you get emotional and start challenging 4 feeders from your team.10. Every noob who has a lvl 30 account can play ranked games. It is enough to have 10 or 15 heroes and a 30 account level.11. In a ranked game, you can choose a character that you have never played and you can't play with it :) it doesn't matter. You can ruin your team's game and you'll be fine.12. You wait 10 minutes for the game. you enter the game after waiting a long time for other players and find out that someone has left the game. (at this point the game should be stopped automatically to save players' time) SORRY NO! the game continues even if you are playing 5 vs.3.to surrender the game, all players from your team must agree, if even one presses NO, you continue to play 5 vs 3 :) total stupidity and waste of players' time.",

They don't care about the players' opinion, they never give the players what they want and what is needed for the game to be better and you could easily say that the developers don't even play their game cause if they did there is no way it would be this bad. Aside from these problems there is also the community. League of Legends has one of the most if not THE MOST TOXIC COMMUNITY you can find in game. And this continues to exist due to the lack of proper punishment of toxic players. Anything from afks to people literally losing the game intentionally doesn't get banned. Their report system is an automatic system that does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING and if you think that sending a ticket works then jokes on you. Riot has your back and they're ignoring every ticket too. So please, do yourself a favor and don't play this game. It's a waste of time and not only does in not benefit you in any way but it actually makes you sad.",

There's no balance, matchmaking is terrble, and there's no comeback mechanic so you get behind early and just suffer for 15 minutes until you surrender and/or lose. Community is toxic. Impossible to carry as one person. One bad player on ur team and game is unwinnable. Or maybe their comp just counters yours and it's unwinnable. If you're in your series then you can expect to get destroyed because your team will be awful and their team will play really well and as a unit... Every game is so one-sided. One team gets smashed and the other team can just chimp out with their gold lead and win no matter how bad they play. Wouldn't recommend playing. I don't know why I still play. Maybe it was fun for a while but it's pretty much always miserable now... But I continue to play... If the game was balanced and matchmaking was good I think it would be a great game but it's just so far from that. I find myself staying up so late at night becuase I just want to win a game... Really feels awful. I've quit a few times, the longest for 6 months but I inevitably come back. So don't start playing. Seems like that's the only way to not play.... To stay away completely. I've spent quite a bit of money on this free game lol. The aesthetics are nice and the skins are cool and everything... Watching people play is fun. But playing the game is depressing. I have two accounts in plat so it's not like I'm some god. And maybe I don't deserve to climb, but I typically find that I'm better than most of the people I meet in my games. Doesn't tend to matter though as people enjoy playing braindead champs and I really don't. Or they just have a team or whatever. It perplexes me that challenger players get challenger every time. There must be some aspect of carrying that they can consistently climb. Or maybe it's just the number of games. I play a few games each day on average. Mostly losses. But playing more would be even more losses, wouldn't it? Tilt queue is good for no one... Idk. I have a smurf in silver and it's actually stuck there. I just keep losing. Maybe the problem is I play adc and there's just so many champs that invalidate my role... Unlucky, I guess.",

I still love parts of it, especially the world, and the characters (most, less so some of the recent ones)When I first played it was the first multiplayer online game I'd played, I'd heard about how toxic the community was but i could deal with being called names and being told to kms, although I was surprised when one player told me he did awful things to a child he held captive in his basement every time I'd kill him in game. I don't think I'll ever forget that game.My issue with the game is not the player base, many games have toxic players, and in general I think Riot do an ok job of dealing with toxicity, not a great job, but an ok job. Maybe less than ok, but I digress, my issue is that the people who make the game have no passion, playing it for 5 years, it's very easy to see exactly how the game has changed. LOL has gone from a passion project to a product, a 'game' with the aim to drain it's player base of as much money as it can, and again it shows. I've made multiple accounts throughout the years, and recently, on my newer accounts, I've been non stop advertised to by Riot within the client in a way I just wasn't when I made my first account back in 2015. 'Buy skins', 'Buy XP boosts', 'Buy stat tracking'. Guys, I've just made an account, I'm not gonna shell out £50 on an account that's 2 minutes old. Stat tracking should not cost extra, ever, in any game. Ever.I used to describe league as fun, the first thing that comes to mind sadly when I think of LOL is 'money-grabbing'.I saw a review of League titled something like \"I've never seen a game fall so far\", and I think it's the truth. The people who make the client should be ashamed, as I write this, I'm in a 57 minute game queue, I'm not, but the client believes I am. Their client is full of bugs and issues, that they have no intention of resolving, once again because these issues do not affect their bottom line.This review has got very long....but this is my view of the game based on my experience, finally I will say, please Riot games, just give League of Legends to a games company who have passion for their work.Also your support staff is a joke, stop outsourcing your support, it does. not. work.",

Like, you just have one mode to play \"Where you lose 40 min of your life for nothing\", the others are forgotten and aram is just trash at this point cause of many wrong changes, so bad work riot, nice artist tho, but the game is just a thing must be erased at this moment, like JUST work in the game and forget about skins and crap, you have enough money at this point to get good programmers, as an old player from the game, i feel so ashamed and sad about the game, don't give them more money or ads, let the game die for good.Maybe keep the work on the new games, but the league as we known before is done and erased from existance.",

  "review": "I been playing league since season 4. I love it . I have mastered yasuo, zed ,akali , Lee , irelia etc. And many more champion. Season 11 destroy the game. Here are some reason. My champion pool that is high level mechanic now all become trash.  With skill can't even win. Last time is who have best skill win. Now it's all it items, objective, better team win. No comeback. Number 1Toxicity I playing at SEA server the report system still is not working. People in the game are toxic if your teammate is not happy with you they can afk , troll , inting. Or follow you around the map and if I report them they won't get ban. And if they not happy  they will say \"your mom die\". Which is terrible. I played for so many years during when I start playing people don't say such stuff at that time people try to win no matter what and positive attitude . We can honour enemy and our team. And enemy and my own would be happy don't care lose or win. At ending of season 5 coming to 6 toxic start to get more and more serious. People start to curse you every game . Well that happens until now still happening. Report system don't work. I reported countless all I can say is 2/10. When I get notified of the punishment. The game is unpleasant all I can say people curse at you like your a dog . And if you defend yourself by talking bad even though with no bad words and  that guy report you back you get chat restrictions which is dumb. And that guy who curse get 0 punishment.Now season 11 is pure tragic . Even if you mute all. Your team will do provoking stuff to make you angry.Like trolling stealing your minion , stand there and watch you die without helping. Number 2Champion and item are more broken than before season 11. Some champion like graves , orn , Viktor. Season 11 is bad. Generally all ap champion skill is over buff it hurts alot the damage even though at level 1 which is ridiculous. 1 skill almost half of my hp gone.  Item for sp too much ap I main talon. I can't kill a sp when I am 2 item ahead and 2 level up . And have 10 kills and the janna only 1/5/0. And she has all sp item. She can burst me with her w and q. The ap is too much.The build path for tiamat and suck. I don't understand why remove gunblade , and tiamat active , bork active. All of these item are good already. All of these new item the mytic I feel useless.  I play talon last season can 1 shot enemy if I am fed. Now even if I am very fed I can't do anything. I can't even 1 shot a sp. Which is ridiculous. Assassin meta ? Season 11? More like tank and ap meta. I don't like the new item. And all of the item all too expensive. Number 3Shop interface. The icons all look the same. Even the old item has change the look completely which i don't even recognize. Everything change The icon all become so small and all left and right so confusing. The old shop let me filter all of the item and search function which is easier. My thought of the game. The game is fun last time. But it's not league anymore. It's a totally different game now. Last time you can 1 v 9. If you have the skill you can climb. After they change the game to team oriented objective oriented . It become trash that's all I can say. Already having trash team . Every game last season longest last for 45 to 50min. Now season 11 each game last 1 hour. I am not kidding. The game became longer. Which is draining and tiring. And last time can solo carry if you are good in mechanics now you rarely can. If enemy have 2 to 3 tanks and cc game over. And people won't surrender no matter what. 50 vs 3. They still won't surrender. If I afk I get ban or punish which is stupid. It's a waste of time. Rank match making is pure garbage that's all I can say. My team skill level and enemy skill level is like heaven and hell. This big of a gap. My skill level and decision making is good . Even if I am super fed did everything right. But my team feeds or int 0/10. And enemy super fed it's game over. Enemy has all the dragon and everything game over. Enemy has better team composition game over. It is always the same. 1 team stomp the other. Even at worlds before season 11. Already can see who can win. Which team will win. The one get all the dragon win. The one who has tanks and cc win. It's boring. The game has become boring. Last time season 4 faker. Outplay mechanics. And skills. And even till now I watch the old league before all of the focus on objective and team play all these stuff. All is pure mechanics and skill. Season 9 onwards changed. Team play when my team sucks. I can't win. It's not my fault my team keep feed and int my competitive makes me angry because of my team are suck I lose its not my fault . Why should I lose and deduct LP. The game is not fun anymore.It is not the league I know or love anymore. It is full of toxic,anger, 0 skill All about team play, better comp, Smash button champion. Season 9 is not the league I know anymore. Season 11 is not the game I want to play anymore. It's just bad",

And still played it until now, that new patch destroyed your game.first: *champions are broken* I liked league so much because of the diversity of champs, each champ had some kind of skill set they could use and it was up to you how and when to use them. Now it feels like every new champion is like the old kata jump in and press every f cking button until you kill them, 0 SKILL. Like what tf is Seraphine, everybody was hyped about her and then you ruined her by changing her into Sona 2.0 with steroids. Second: *I hate the new shop*WHAT IN THE WORLD IS THIS NEW SHOP, NOTHING MAKES SENSE. Honestly tho, my brain hurts after opening it. It feels like I'm playing a moba game, just keep pressing the next item and you will get there. The filter system is so f cking bad. It used to be easier just read it and you know what to filter. Now I have to memorize every f cking symbole, for what??? It was not necessary. Even when I tried to memorize it, I couldn't. Not everyone has 20/20 vision, I used to make the shop bigger cause I couldn't see all them items very clearly. You guys took that out aswell. Like why, omg...Third problem *Items*I know you guys tried to come up with something new and flashy, but no... I'm gonna be honest some of the new items are good and I would love to play with them, but the items you guys took out of the game and changed just made it harder for the rest to even play. Tiamat??? why dafuc can ranged champions buy it. It doesn't make any sense, Tiamat is supposed to help close ranged champions to farm easier and faster so they can get out of the situation as quick as possible. Champions with a longer range, they can kite and deal damage from a safe distance. LIKE WHAT TF, do you guys even know what you're doing.... That whole mythic and legendary thing is a cool idea, but I believe you guys put it in the game cause you knew the items would be broken and tried to balance it out with mytics. But it didn't... And my last problem WHY DAFUC DO THE ITEMS LOOK LIKE THAT. They look ALL the SAME. A lot of color no structure, just like I said before press the next item and you will get there. smh...Overall I'm not playing this game anymore. I'm honestly done been playing for 6 years and thought there would be many more, but this last patch ain't it. Fix it, cause I think alot of players think the same way and will quit league because of it.",

I have in total spent 500+ Euro on the game, and when I inquired about my money after my ban, I was litterally told: \"Tough luck, buddy.\"My first account of 10 years was banned for \"general toxicity\". This means I told a troll to \"get a f cking life\" after inting the entire game. (Was 1/37)Second was because I talked sh t about the new items - who suck. And Said \"f ck riot man\".

New items : * Wow...what were you thinking. Im okay with changing cooldown reduction with haste etc. But the items are just so overturned, what were you thinking.  * The game is decided before 10 minutes, and by the team who can just buy better mythic items.The item changes are so massive that countless champions just burst you, doesn't matter how tanky you are. * ADC is dead. Bye-bye my main role.  With all these assassins items and super beefy tanks who's items make them take % less dmg and deal % of dmg back, so they just stand there and watch you die.Dont want to even think about this game anymore. 10 years of playing and its kind of done. The game will die and the only way to save it, is to scratch the whole season 11 idea and start over.Well Played RITO",

Champs are horribly outbalanced and new champs have so much power creep in their kit it takes months for riot to gut their kit until the champ is barely played or becomes one of their best, there is no true balancing or consequences for players who run rampant ruining games and wasting people's times. This game is in the worst state it could possibly ever achieve and there's nothing riot games will do about it cause as long as they can keep pushing anime style skins out for their most popular champs the more incentive their given to not take initiative to fix their terrible game.

If it is not, you proved to be a neglectful and all around trashy company. If you don't know what I am talking about, the loop bug is the client, saying you are in-game when you are not, tries to reconnect you to a match that no longer exists. Of course I tried fixing the problem, and I did try EVERYTHING short of putting a fist through my screen. But it isn't my pc's fault, it is undoubtedly Riot's. If I want to play this game at all I am going to have to get a whole new account, for my current one is as good as permabanned, isn't it? I only had this game for a week. Could you imagine if I had a several years old account like most others? I would literally pass out in rage, then do EVERYTHING in my power to defame this awful company when I come to.

If you're not perfect 100% of the time, you will get flamed all game, and if you're doing well, then the rest of your team will be struggling. The people who do well, devote their entire life and soul to the game, studying all the math, statistics, and matchups every patch like it's their full time career. A lot of them will be the ones harassing you, cussing you out, and hurling all kinds of disgusting slurs and unhelpful, inappropriate comments. You have to be perfect to start playing this game according to most players otherwise you should uninstall. (Cause that's how they got good at the game.) Riot doesn't care about people being toxic and reports mean nothing, cause no one actually gets punished,, cause they want their money.

So people don't care, and if they do get banned, well the games free so they just make a new account and go back to ripping some dude on the internet that they've never met because their dick is 0.5 inches.I really hate this game with a burning passion, nothings going to change, riot is just in it for the money, the community is trash, and the launcher is so buggy that it makes Bethesda look like they actually bug fix before releasing a game.",

Abuse like this in real life would result in a police report. A restraint order. People rage, rage, rage, abuse with the most nasty, evil things to say; the raging comes from the game developers not making games evenly matched. In about 20 games you will have ONE evenly matched game; hence you will have a handful )or up to almost half) your games where your team is the stronger team BY FAR and there is zero contest; but this still creates abuse because people become cocky/full of themselves and taunt and abuse the other team (and still abuse each other EVEN if winning). The other larger handful/up to half of your games will be 100% mismatched where your team has NO chance of winning and this creates raging/unfair feelings.. then you will enjoy literally 1 to 2 MAXIMUM nice/even/hard but fun games where the teams are even. This will repeat over and over and over as you get more and more disappointed, frustrated and literally emotionally BEATEN DOWN by angry children, angrier teenagers and still developing young adult boys who say things such as \"go f'ing neck yourself\" amongst any other evil, gross or cruel thing you could possibly think of. You will get all of this and more in league of legends and especially in ranked! Do not bother. Do not spend a cent.
